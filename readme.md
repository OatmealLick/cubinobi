# Cubinobi - Metroidvania Platformer Study #

This is an attempt to recreate most of the controls for a now-classic metroidvania style game.
The reference for the mechanics is Hollow Knight, although slight variations in the movement may appear.
It's an attempt to learn as much as possible how such code may differ from other applications, both in gamedev world (strategy game) or non-gamedev world (web app).
Below is a list of things I learned for anyone interested including myself from the future.

## State ##

There is a lot of state, that is intertwined and it's not easy to break it up using 'classic' Clean Code tactics.

Also
Low level, physics equations + modifications for the game feel.
Structuring code so that most of the things is reusable (pushing for 100% is arbitrary and painful)
